  description: The lab is interested in parsing the variability that is hallmark to adolescent decision-making. Thinking on our own experiences as humans, we know that it is unlikely that we make the exact same choice all or none of the time in a given decision context. This is especially true in adolescence, when individuals are granted greater autonomy to explore their environment on their own. We want to know what drives adolescent decision behavior by examining when and why teens make certain kinds of choices. We currently focus on two categories of teen choice behavior. First, we care about evaluating and refining popular scientific models of adolescent risk-taking, especially in ecologically relevant contexts (e.g., substance use, driving behavior). Second, we are curious about how teens’ social decision preferences involving known others (e.g., how do they navigate choices that outcomes for multiple known others, sometimes in conflicting ways?). Dr. Guassi Moreira is accepting students and trainees who are interested in this line of work.

  description: Emotions are constant companions of our internal lives, blanketing every waking (and many non-waking) moments. Emotions can help us deftly navigate the world, but can also lead us astray if left unchecked. Adolescence is an important time for emotional development. Teens are in the process of acquiring novel regulatory skills and refining others. In the CDNLab, we conceptualize emotion regulation acquisition as a process of specialization. Through this lens, we seek to understand how age- and experience-related changes in emotion regulation skills are supported by individual brain regions and networks that may become increasingly tuned towards emotion regulation (albeit not exclusively). Keeping with the theme of specialization, we’re also interested in understanding how various repertoires of various emotion regulation strategies can be optimized for developmental wellbeing outcomes.

  description: Often, the most consequential and meaningful behaviors that teens engage in involve the presence of specific, known others -- teachers in the classroom, classmates on the school bus, parents and siblings at the dinner table, and so on. Yet, so much psychological research on social behavior remains a science of strangers. This research arc of the lab is concerned with explaining and predict social behavior in its proper ecological context—that is, behavior regarding specific and known others relevant to daily life—by using high density sampling and ecological momentary assessment in conjunction with fine-grained estimates of mental representations of said others. We want to know how and why teens allocate their time between various known others, how they feel and what activities they complete when doing so. The goal of this arc of work is to help push the field towards translating knowledge gained-in lab to predict and understand real-world behavior.

  description: Scientific advancement is impossible without methodological advancement. A nascent line of work in the lab seeks to help develop and refine methods as they relate to the problems that we and other groups face in pursuing the research described above. For us, this means taking a methodological issue that is frequently encountered in our work (e.g., necessary sample sizes for a specific type of model) and systematically probing the issue in an independent study in a such way that generates useful knowledge that can generalize to other scientists in our field (e.g., running simulation study to ascertain the minimum number of subjects need to fit saidmodel). We also believe in the importance of creating practical and accessible reviews of emergent methods to help spur their adoption in research groups that are interested in using them but do not have prior experience. Dr. Guassi Moreira is accepting students who are interested in this line of work.
