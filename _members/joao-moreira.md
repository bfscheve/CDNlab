João is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab. He is interested in affective and social phenomena, specifically in the context of emotion regulation and decision-making. In CSNLab, João is using functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with computational methods to investigate how mental representations of others shape decision behaviors involving familiar others. He hopes that one downstream application of this work will be to promote the development of healthy mental wellbeing in youths. He previously received his BS in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and completed his Ph.D. in developmental psychology with Jennifer Silvers at UCLA. If you manage to find João outside the lab, you’ve probably caught him at bar trivia, rock climbing, or exploring the Great Los Angeles Abyss. In 2024, João will begin as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
