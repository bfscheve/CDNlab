My name is Sullivan Greenberg, Iâ€™m a sophomore at UW-Madison studying psychology. I have a strong passion for working with families and children/adolescents. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, cooking and being with my dogs. In the future, I hope to work with children in a clinical setting, supporting their growth and well-being.
