My name is Jemma Nelson, and I am a sophomore at UW-Madison studying Psychology and Human Development and Family Studies. I have a strong passion for developmental research and mental health advocacy. In my free time, I enjoy reading and going on walks with friends. In the future, I hope to pursue a PhD in either counseling or clinical psychology.
