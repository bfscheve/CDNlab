My name is Ayusman Khuntia, and I am a junior at UW-Madison studying Computer Science and Data Science. I have a strong interest in machine learning and its real-world applications. In my free time, I enjoy watching F1 and NBA games, as well as attending concerts. In the future, I hope to further explore machine learning and contribute to innovative projects in the field.
