Our work fundamentally concerns how youths acquire cognitive, affective, and social skills
needed to navigate life in a world that is rich, complex, and often messy. This motivates us to
study three broad content areas: emotion and emotion regulation, risky behavior and decision-
making, and interactions with known, specific social partners. To comprehensively understand
phenomena under these banners, we use data collection methods such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), capture of naturalistic written text, and ecological momentary
assessment to glean insights into the hidden structures of the human mind that are not so
easily observed otherwise. Our work is inclusive to data is collected by the lab, in collaboration
with other individual labs, and large consortia study (e.g., ABCD). To analyze these data, we use
a bevy of advanced computational techniques from the fields of computer science, behavioral
economics, and quantitative psychology. By doing so we aim to provide tractable explanations
of why certain developmental phenomena occur the way they do, while also being able to
model future events. Finally, we also dabble in the development of statistical methods in service
of aiding scientists with research goals similar to our own.
