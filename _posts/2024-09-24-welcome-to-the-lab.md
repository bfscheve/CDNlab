We are excited to announce the launch of the Computational Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Our lab is dedicated to understanding the neural mechanisms that shape socioemotional development during adolescence, with a particular focus on risky decision-making, emotion regulation, and social relationships. By combining cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and computational modeling, we aim to shed light on how brain activity supports the complex behaviors that emerge during this pivotal stage of life.
Stay tuned for updates on our research projects, publications, and opportunities to get involved! You can also follow us on twitter @cdnlab_uwisc
