Dr. Guassi Moreira’s research proposal, _“A Computational Approach to Isolating Mechanisms of Emotion Regulation in Anxiety”_, was awarded the David H. and Beveral A. Barlow Grant from the American Psychological Foundation. This award will fund work in the lab that seeks to build computational models of emotion regulation by leveraging associations between regulatory performance and variability in core features of emotionally evocative stimuli.
