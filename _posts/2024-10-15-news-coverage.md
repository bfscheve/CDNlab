We are excited to share that recent research from our lab was featured in Medical Xpress! The paper, "A behavioral signature to quantify how people attribute mental states to others," was published in Communications Psychology. We developed a method to quantify the social value of a relationship based on a behavioral signature. Social value scores tracked with self-reported relationship quality and also predicted decision preferences on a range of tasks.
