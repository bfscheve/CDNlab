The lab is happy to share that Dr. Guassi Moreira's proposal entitled Neural Signature of Emotion Regulation in Adolescent Risk-Taking has been selected for a Young Investigator Grant by the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (BBRF). This award helps fund a multi-phase study that aims to precisely clarify how emotion regulatory mechanisms are implicated in adolescent risk-taking behavior. The BBRF's Young Investigator program is intended to help launch independent research careers by helping junior investigators gather pilot data to apply to larger grants. Dr. Guassi Moreira and CDNLab are grateful for the efforts of the BBRF's Scientific Council, Program Administrators, and Board of Directors.
