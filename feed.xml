The paper, “A behavioral signature to quantify how people attribute mental states to others,” was published in Communications Psychology. We developed a method to quantify the social value of a relationship based on a behavioral signature. Social value scores tracked with self-reported relationship quality and also predicted decision preferences on a range of tasks.

Our lab is dedicated to understanding the neural mechanisms that shape socioemotional development during adolescence, with a particular focus on risky decision-making, emotion regulation, and social relationships. By combining cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques and computational modeling, we aim to shed light on how brain activity supports the complex behaviors that emerge during this pivotal stage of life.
Stay tuned for updates on our research projects, publications, and opportunities to get involved!
